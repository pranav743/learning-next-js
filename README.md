# L1: Redis Caching + Cron Job for Bulk Book Processing in a Books App

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a Books Management API using Node.js and Express that supports user authentication and CRUD operations for books, enhanced with Redis caching and a cron job for bulk book insertion.

## Requirements

### 1. User Authentication
- Implement routes for user signup and login.
- Authentication can be session-based, JWT-based, or any secure method.
- Each authenticated user should have their own isolated data namespace in Redis.

### 2. Book CRUD Operations
- Implement standard CRUD routes for managing books:
  - `GET /books` - List all books for the authenticated user.
  - `POST /books` - Add a new book.
  - `PUT /books/:id` - Update a book by ID.
  - `DELETE /books/:id` - Delete a book by ID.

### 3. Redis Caching
- Cache the response of the `GET /books` route in Redis for each user separately.
- Subsequent GET requests should serve data from Redis if available.
- On any change (add, update, delete), invalidate the corresponding Redis cache for that user.

### 4. Bulk Books Insertion via Redis + Cron Job
- Implement a route: `POST /books/bulk`
  - Accepts an array of books for the authenticated user.
  - Instead of immediately inserting into the database, store this array in Redis under a user-specific key.
  - Return a response immediately: "Books will be added later."
- Implement a cron job that runs every 2 minutes.
  - The job should read all pending bulk book arrays from Redis for all users.
  - For each user, insert the bulk books into the database.
  - Remove the processed entries from Redis after successful insertion.

## Additional Expectations
- Redis keys for caching and bulk books must be scoped by user ID or username to ensure data separation.
- Proper error handling and validation.
- Efficient Redis usage (e.g., using hashes or sets as appropriate).
- Secure handling of user authentication tokens or sessions.
- The cron job should not block the main app and should handle failures gracefully.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional API supporting the above features.
- Documentation/comments explaining how caching and cron jobs are implemented.
- Instructions on how to test the bulk books insertion flow with Redis and cron jobs.
